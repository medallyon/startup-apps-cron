# apps/

Use this directory to store collections of startup apps.

## Setting up

1. Create a Folder here to store collections of shortcuts or commandlets
	1. Name your folder something descriptive, like in the example above
1. Within your folder, include a `schedule.txt` in the form of a cron schedule
	1. Example: `* * 7-17 * * 1-5` would match every weekday (`1-5`) between the hours of 07:00 - 17:00 (`7-17`)
1. Within your folder, also include as many executables or shortcuts as you like
